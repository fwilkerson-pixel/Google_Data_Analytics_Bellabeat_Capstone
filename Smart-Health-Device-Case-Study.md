## Introduction
Founded in 2013, Bellabeat is a health-focused, high-tech company that designs smart wellness products specifically for women. While Bellabeat has found success as a small player in the market, it has the potential to expand its footprint in the growing global smart device industry.

In this case study, I was tasked with analyzing external smart device usage data to uncover patterns and trends in consumer behavior. The goal of this analysis is to generate actionable insights that can inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy and support data-driven decision-making.

The findings and recommendations presented here are intended for Bellabeat’s executive team, providing a strategic overview that can help the company better position itself in a competitive, health-conscious market.
